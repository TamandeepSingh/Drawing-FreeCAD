# Drawing-FreeCAD

In this project, the user will be able to enter the specifications of the building through web browser using Django (Python Web Framework) and on the back-end, the FreeCAD macros will use those input values to draw the drawings of different views of the building on different drawing sheets. The output of the same can then be taken by user in svg, pdf and fcstd formats.
